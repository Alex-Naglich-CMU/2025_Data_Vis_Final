        <h2>Subtheme: Fentanyl</h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How many cases include fentanyl? Does the addition of fent increase
            case numbers? This data alone is insufficient for identifying if
            fentanyl usage is "deadlier", as I would need the rates of
            consumption, not just those that results in death. But it would be
            valuable for demonstrating the absolute severity of fentanyl and
            drive attention to it as a public issue- for example, it would be a
            powerful statement if it were found that 60% of overall overdoses
            contained fentanyl, or that 70% of cocaine overdoses included
            fentanyl.
            <br /><strong>Evidence:</strong> My bartender friend says that most
            cocaine that comes through her bar has fent these days and she is
            getting really worried about coming into contact exposure with it.
            Other evidence is that I know that it only takes an exceedingly
            small dose to be lethal, and that many drugs are cut with fent to
            increase addiction for the benefit of the dealer. So if the dosage
            provided isn't well calibrated, that can be lethal.

            I want to know what zip codes have the most fentanyl. <br /><strong

            I want to know this because I am EMT certified, and I want to know
            where in Allegheny the concentration of fent is. I know that there
            are hotspots for drug usage, and I am curious.
          </li>
          <li>
            Are opioid OD rates, including fentanyl, YoY improving? Simple
            question, but I am curious. With the widespread distribution of
            naloxone, and many people (me included) keeping one nearby, I
            wonder. It would be interesting if lines for distribution programs
            correlated with any drops seen? <br /><strong>Evidence:</strong> Aug
            2024 Narcan vending machines were installed (News sites differ on
            number, but 7 seems the most cited number prevalent. I wonder if
            that's enough for an impact) (WESA). “Since 2021, Pennsylvania’s
            Overdose Prevention Program has provided free Naloxone in bulk”
            (PittNews). Jan 2025 Pitt campus got dispensers. (PittNews) This may
            connect in with the previous question.

            Backup observation, not intended for final inclusion but an
            observation I wanted to share: I noticed you can OD on bupropion,
            which surprised me as I take that. It was recorded as an accident
            and not a suicide attempt. That is interesting, but I chose a
            subtheme of fent, not prescription antidepressants. I may be able to
            connect the combination of fentanyl with prescription vs
            prescription if I require additional figures! I see benadryl there
            as well, which I know is notoriously nasty to OD on
